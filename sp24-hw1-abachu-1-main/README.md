Please clone this repository, edit README.md to answer the questions, and fill up functions to finish the homework.

- Please find each question in a separate folder under [files](/files).
- For non-coding questions, fill out the answers in the README file.
- For coding questions, edit the files and check them in.
- For coding questions unless specified, you should add unit tests to the student_test.cc.
  We will clone and test your repo using your tests and some other tests (that are not provided). Your code should pass all of them.
- For submission, please push your answers to Github before the deadline.
- Rubrics:
  
| Question | Points |

# Question
- Please refer to [files](/files).
- For each question, implement and test it in the [files](/files).
- Write the runtime complexity of each question in this README file.

# Answers
[TODO: Should be filled out with runtime complexity of each question with justification.]

1. The complexity of function 1 is O(n) and function 2 is O(n) since there is only one loop which iterartes through n elements

2. The complexity is O(n) becuase there is only one for loop which iterates through n elements

3.The complexity is O(n) becuase there is only one for loop which iterates through n elements

4. The complexity is O(n^3) becuase there are three for loops

5. The complexity is O(3^n) becuase it is making 3 recursive calls for each n. The runtime complexity for recursive functions depends on number of function calls its making while executing the function in the worst case

6. The complexity is O(1) because all the operations are constant time operations and we ignore constants while writing Big O notation

7. The complexity is O(1) because all the operations are constant time operations and we ignore constants while writing Big O notation
